				<p class="intro_text">Wondering which <strong>Hogwarts Legacy spells</strong> you’ll be casting in the halls of the famous school? Spellcasting is of course one of the biggest draws of attending Hogwarts – that and getting into magical mischief – so which spells will we be able to use in Hogwarts legacy, and how will spellcasting and combat work?

		  <h2>All Hogwarts Legacy spells</h2>
		  <p>At this time, we don’t yet know every spell that will be available in Hogwarts Legacy as the developers are leaving some things to be revealed once the game is here. However, thanks to gameplay videos and trailers, there are a few that we know already. We’ll keep updating this list as more known spells become available.
		  
		  
		  </p><p><strong>Here is every spell in Hogwarts Legacy:</strong>
		  
		  
		  </p><ul>
		  <li><strong>Accio</strong> – pull an item or combatant toward you.</li>
		  <li><strong>Alohomora</strong> – unlocks doors and objects, like chests.</li>
		  <li><strong>Confringo</strong> – launches a fireball at your enemy.</li>
		  <li><strong>Descendo</strong> – slams enemies into the ground.</li>
		  <li><strong>Incendio</strong> – set fire to items or opponents.</li>
		  <li><strong>Lumos</strong> –&nbsp;illuminates the surrounding area.</li>
		  <li><strong>Petrificus Totalus</strong> – Freezes foes so they cannot move.</li>
		  <li><strong>Protego</strong> – grants you a shield.</li>
		  <li><strong>Revelio</strong> – reveal nearby objects.</li>
		  <li><strong>Stupefy</strong> – stun an opponent.</li>
		  <li><strong>Wingardium Leviosa</strong> – lift items and combatants into the air.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>And even the unforgivable curses:
		  
		  
		  </p><ul>
		  <li><strong>Avada Kedavra</strong> – kill your target.</li>
		  <li><strong>Crucio</strong> – inflict incredible pain on your target.</li>
		  <li><strong>Imperio</strong> – force enemies to fight on your behalf.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>As you level up, complete <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hogwarts-legacy/challenges" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="text_link">Hogwarts Legacy challenges</a>, and earn experience, you can upgrade your spells to make them more powerful in preparation for increasingly difficult battles.

		  </p><h2>How to use spells in Hogwarts Legacy</h2>
		  <p>The 20-plus spells in Hogwarts Legacy can be split into two groups: slottable spells and essential spells. While you can choose your favourite slottable spells to keep in your “spell diamond” for quick access and can change them around at will, essential spells are deemed more crucial by the developers, and are more likely to be needed in any situation – Revelio is one of these.
		  
		  
		  </p><p>So far, we only know how spells are used on a controller – though presumably this can be changed in settings. How you’ll access your spells using a keyboard and mouse remains a mystery at this time. Your four chosen spells will be accessed from the spell diamond in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen by holding down your controller’s right trigger button and then pressing the relevant button for your desired spell. Your essential spell is accessed using the left button on the d-pad. Choose and change your spells using the right d-pad button.
		  
		  
		  </p><p>Through the course of the game, you have the chance to unlock up to three additional spell diamonds, meaning you can have 16 specific spells at your fingertips, ready for combat. Rather than filling the bottom of the screen with spell diamonds, simply use the d-pad while holding the right trigger button to scroll through your preset diamonds.
		  
		  
		  </p><p>To access your spell diamond, it is essential that you are holding that right trigger though, because just tapping it will trigger a basic spell, such as Accio. In combat, this spell can be seen at the top of the screen. Press the right trigger multiple times to chain a combo of attacks.

		  </p><h3>Crossed Wands duelling club</h3>
		  <p>A bit overwhelmed? Yeah, us too. Thankfully, that’s where Crossed Wands comes in, the duelling club that will give you your first taste of combat in Hogwarts Legacy. Located in the clock tower, the Crossed Wands duelling club allows you to practise this fast-paced spellcasting, and get to grips with your spells, combos, and cooldowns.
		  
		  
		  </p><h2>How does Avada Kedavra work in Hogwarts Legacy?</h2>
		  <p>The Avada Kedavra spell is no doubt the most famous spell in the wizarding world, and the darker wizards out there may be wondering how it will be used in Hogwarts Legacy. It’s a powerful spell, instantly killing its target, so you’d think would be a pretty game-breaking spell in a videogame, right? Avalanche Studios has taken this into consideration, and seem to have worked out the perfect balance for the <em>killer</em> spell.
		  
		  
		  </p><p>First of all, yes, you can use the unforgivable curse, and, yes, Avada Kedavra will instantly kill a lower-level opponent. As you can probably imagine though, the cooldown on Avada Kedavra is going to be <em>considerably</em> longer than any other spell in the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-rpgs-pc" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="text_link">RPG game</a>, so make sure you use it wisely. You can, however, use certain Hogwarts Legacy potions to reduce that cooldown.
		  
		  
		  </p><p>That’s everything we know about all the Hogwarts Legacy spells for now. As we eagerly await the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hogwarts-legacy/release-date" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="text_link">Hogwarts Legacy release date</a>, answer some of the most important questions about school life, like will the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hogwarts-legacy/room-of-requirement" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="text_link">Hogwarts Legacy Room of Requirement</a> appear for you, who the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hogwarts-legacy/characters" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="text_link">Hogwarts Legacy characters</a> are, and <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hogwarts-legacy/harry-potter" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="text_link">is Harry Potter in Hogwarts Legacy</a>? Even more importantly, perhaps, is your house, so if you don’t want to leave your sorting up to chance, make sure you know <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hogwarts-legacy/house-wand-import-rewards" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="text_link">how to import your house and wand to Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and you’ll be rewarded with exclusive house robes.
